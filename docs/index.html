    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
      MaxVideoAI keeps every control—composer, wallet, job feed, and gallery rail—inside one live dashboard so you can pick the right engine for every shot.
      Switch between Sora-grade cinematic renders, Veo advertising takes, Pika social loops, or regional engines like MiniMax without juggling separate subscriptions.
      Live pricing chips show the exact wallet impact before you press <em>Generate</em>, and funds only move when a render succeeds.

    <h2>Who MaxVideoAI is for</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creative studios that need consistent AI video output without bouncing between closed betas or private dashboards.</li>
      <li>Agencies and marketing teams that prototype campaigns on multiple engines before presenting a treatment.</li>
      <li>Developers, indie makers, and motion designers who want one composer for text-to-video, image-to-video, and first/last frame bridging.</li>
      <li>Brands experimenting with AI-powered product films who require transparent costs and replayable job history.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Live multi-engine composer.</strong> Duration, resolution, FPS, audio, and aspect ratio controls adapt based on each engine’s capabilities, so you only see the knobs that matter.</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt Lab & presets.</strong> Reuse proven prompts, drag in reference images, and keep image-to-video runs aligned with your brand look.</li>
      <li><strong>Model comparison rail.</strong> Every engine ships with badges, price chips, and example clips so you can judge strengths (cinematic, product detail, stylised, etc.) at a glance.</li>
      <li><strong>Job feed + gallery.</strong> Monitor renders as they progress, compare iterations side-by-side, and download videos, thumbnails, and metadata instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Pay-as-you-go wallet.</strong> Top up Starter Credits (from $10), unlock member tiers for savings, and only pay when a render succeeds. Refunds trigger automatically if a provider fails.</li>
      <li><strong>Always-current pricing.</strong> Live “This render” chips refresh under 200ms every time you tweak duration, resolution, or add-ons like 4K upscale or audio.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supported AI Video Engines</h2>
    <p>
      MaxVideoAI integrates leading AI video models including Sora&nbsp;2, Sora&nbsp;2 Pro, Veo&nbsp;3.1, Veo&nbsp;3.1 Fast, LTX-2 Fast, LTX-2 Pro, Kling&nbsp;2.6 Pro, Pika&nbsp;2.2, MiniMax Hailuo&nbsp;02, Wan&nbsp;2.5, and Nano Banana variants. Routing is handled through Fal.ai so availability stays aligned with provider limits, and trademarks remain with their respective owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Availability can vary by provider or region, but the workspace keeps a “Works with” ticker updated and refreshes engine-specific pricing automatically, ensuring you always know which models are live before you brief a shot.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick an engine tile (cinematic, fast iteration, stylised, or regional) and load the preset for your use case.</li>
      <li>Write a prompt, optionally upload image references, and select First/Last frame bridging if your story needs stable bookends.</li>
      <li>Dial in duration, aspect ratio, FPS, and add-ons such as native audio or 4K upscale—the composer shows only options that engine supports.</li>
      <li>Review the live wallet estimate, press <em>Generate</em>, and watch the job feed capture previews, statuses, and downloads as soon as Fal.ai returns the clip.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why use MaxVideoAI instead of individual tools?</h2>
    <p>
      Without MaxVideoAI, you would juggle multiple waitlists, API keys, and pricing calculators, often paying separate subscriptions or minimum balances for each engine.
      MaxVideoAI centralises the workflow: the workspace mirrors how the team ships client work every day, pricing stays transparent, wallet spend is visible in the header, and your team can jump between engines without losing prompt history or job context.
      It is the fastest way to test engines side-by-side, deliver consistent clips, and keep finance aligned with actual usage rather than theoretical credits.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Do I need multiple subscriptions for each model?</h3>
    <p>
      No. You top up a single MaxVideoAI wallet (Starter Credits begin at $10) and the app charges your balance only when a render succeeds.
      Member tiers unlock automatic savings, and you never have to negotiate separate billing for Sora, Veo, Pika, or any other engine surfaced inside the workspace.
    </p>

    <h3>What resolutions and durations are supported?</h3>
    <p>
      Each engine has its own capabilities—some excel at 6–8 second cinematic shots with audio, others stretch to 12 seconds or prioritise fast 4–6 second drafts.
      Most engines output 1080p by default, with select models supporting 4K upscale or ultra-wide aspect ratios. The composer enforces these limits automatically so you always stay within a provider’s safe zone.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I use MaxVideoAI for commercial projects?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. The live workspace is production-ready today.
      Review the Business Source License (BUSL 1.1) terms in the repository and, for enterprise or extended licensing discussions, contact the team to align on the appropriate commercial agreement.
