Veo V2 is now live inside MaxVideo AI. The new cinematic controls let you choose framing, dolly moves, and tone feedback before you render. Pair the controls with Price Before to see how each shot impacts your wallet.

Key upgrades include:

- Filmic presets for close-up, medium, and wide shots.
- Dolby Vision previews that match your final renders.
- Faster queue transparency with live wait-time estimates.

Members on Plus and Pro tiers get early access to Veo V2 templates in Express. Everyone else can request access from the status bar.
