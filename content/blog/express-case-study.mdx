Retail brand **Northline** needed forty captioned clips for a limited-release campaign. With Express templates, the team routed prompts to Pika for vertical cuts and to Luma for photoreal hero shots â€” all while Price Before kept finance in the loop.

Highlights:

1. Shared wallet with auto top-up ensured the team never stalled.
2. Caption and voiceover add-ons were previewed in the estimator before queueing.
3. Final renders were delivered to Drive and Dropbox with approvals logged in-line.

The result? Forty approved clips, synced captions, and a launch that came in 8% under budget.
