*Frame, color-grade, and direct your AI shots like a filmmaker.*

---

## Introduction

Until now, text-to-video generation often felt like a gamble — you typed a prompt, crossed your fingers, and hoped for a decent composition. With **Veo 3** inside **MaxVideoAI**, that uncertainty finally disappears.

The engine now offers **Cinematic Controls** that let you shape your video’s framing, tone, and motion *before* rendering. In other words, Veo is evolving from a text interpreter into a **virtual director’s camera**.

---

## 🎥 What’s New in Veo 3

### 1️⃣ Framing Controls

Choose among three presets:

- **Close-up** – ideal for emotion, testimonials, or product detail shots.
- **Medium** – classic lifestyle framing and interview setups.
- **Wide** – landscapes, hero shots, or establishing scenes.

Each preset adjusts focal length, camera distance, and depth of field. Example snippet:

```text
Scene: sunset on a beach, couple talking softly.
Framing: medium close-up, handheld motion.
Lighting: golden hour with soft shadows.
Tone: cinematic and nostalgic.
```

### 2️⃣ Motion & Dolly Moves

Veo 3 interprets cues such as *“slow dolly forward”*, *“orbit around subject”*, or *“handheld, organic shake”*. Combined with temporal diffusion, shots gain smoother parallax and more natural momentum.

### 3️⃣ Dolby Vision Previews

Previews now use Dolby Vision tone mapping — what you see in-app matches the final render. Shadows, highlights, and color balance stay consistent, removing guesswork in post.

### 4️⃣ Queue Transparency

Live wait-time estimates show exactly when your job will start and finish. Production teams can stack renders and schedule hand-offs without refreshing dashboards.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

Veo 3 bridges the gap between **AI generation** and **cinematography**. Instead of “prompt in, clip out,” you can now *direct* — select a lens, control tone, and iterate with intention.

Benefits for marketers and filmmakers:

- Faster storyboard iterations without reshoots.
- Consistent framing across a campaign deliverable.
- Predictable color science for brand-safe content.

## 🧩 Using Veo 3 in MaxVideoAI

### Step-by-step

1. Log in to your **MaxVideoAI** workspace.
2. Navigate to **Models → Veo 3**.
3. Pick your framing and tone preset (e.g., *Cinematic Wide, Neutral Tone*).
4. Write your prompt or paste a timeline script.
5. Click **Preview Price** to estimate cost before rendering.
6. Launch the render and monitor live queue progress in the job feed.

### Example Workflow

| Scene | Camera                 | Tone            | Notes                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | Wide establishing shot | Warm cinematic  | Sunrise cityscape      |
| 2     | Medium                 | Neutral         | Product demo in studio |
| 3     | Close-up               | Cool commercial | Logo reveal on surface |

Render clips individually or sequence them through the **Workflows** tab to assemble longer ads or narrative pieces.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Combine framing presets with sound cues: *“Slow dolly toward subject, add soft ambient piano.”*
- For product A/B testing, render 3-second previews in low-res mode to save credits.
- Use **Clone these settings** on any Veo example clip to duplicate parameters instantly.

---

## 🔬 Behind the Scenes

Veo 3 runs on Google’s **DeepMind Veo 3.1** model, integrated via **Fal.ai** in MaxVideoAI. This setup gives you:

- Pay-as-you-go billing with automatic refunds on failures.
- Access to multiple Veo tiers (Fast, 3.1, 3 Fast) from one wallet.
- A unified composer with the *Price Before You Generate* chip.

Every render is computed live; your credits cover real inference time instead of static templates.

Yes. Express templates remain available, and you can clone settings from any Veo 2 clip into the new workspace.

**Q2. Does Dolby Vision preview change the final export format?**  
No. Previews use Dolby Vision tone mapping, but exports remain standard MP4 unless you opt into future HDR formats.

**Q3. Are framing controls available in Veo Fast?**  
Yes. Fast tiers support the same presets, letting you iterate cheaply before rendering the 3.1 version.

**Q4. How do refunds work if a Veo 3 render fails?**  
Failed jobs automatically credit your wallet within minutes — no tickets required.

**Q5. Can I combine Veo footage with Sora inside MaxVideoAI?**  
Absolutely. Use the Workflows tab to sequence Sora clips and Veo shots into a single narrative.
