  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "Do I have to provide both a first and a last frame?",
      "a": "Yes. First/Last is built to transition between two images; both are required. Use standard Veo 3.1 for pure text/image → video runs."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long can these clips be?",
      "a": "Up to ~8 seconds in the underlying APIs. MaxVideoAI exposes 4/6/8s presets to keep prompts predictable."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does it always generate audio?",
      "a": "You choose audio on/off per render. Audio on gives native ambience/SFX/VO; audio off is cheaper and ready for your own soundtrack."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use First/Last for logo or UI transitions?",
      "a": "Yes. It’s ideal for animating logos or UI layouts from an initial design to a final one. Keep critical tiny text as post-production graphics."
    },
    {
      "q": "When should I use normal Veo instead?",
      "a": "Use standard Veo 3.1 / Veo Fast when you don’t have fixed start/end frames or need multi-beat clips from text/image input."
