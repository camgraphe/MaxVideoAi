      "q": "How do I keep framing consistent across a campaign?",
      "a": "Use the cinematic control presets (close-up, medium, wide) and lock tone styles. Duplicate renders in the queue to reuse camera settings while swapping scripts."

      "q": "Can I blend Veo outputs with Sora runs?",
      "a": "Yes. Block sequences with Veo 3.1, then rerun hero shots in Sora 2 Pro. Upload the Veo frame as a reference in Sora to maintain visual continuity."
