    {
      "q": "What prompt style works best?",
      "a": "Keep prompts structured but concise—two to three sentences covering setting, motion, and tone. Overly long descriptions can introduce artifacts, while focused cues stay consistent."

    {
      "q": "How do I handle upscales?",
      "a": "Route the resulting clip through the MaxVideoAI upscaler or rerun the same prompt in Veo 3 Fast for a sharper pass. Pricing transparency helps you compare before committing credits."
