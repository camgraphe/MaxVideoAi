    "promptingIntro": "Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) rewards short, literal briefs. Lead with composition, then lighting/style. For edits, say what to change and what must stay the same. For multi-image blends, assign each reference a role.",

    "promptingGlobalPrinciples": [
      "Composition first. Style second.",
      "Keep prompts short and specific; avoid long wish-lists.",
      "For edits: \"Change X, keep Y\" beats re-describing the whole scene.",

      "Fast tier favors short prompts; long prompts can wander.",
      "Multi-image works best when each image has a clear role (subject vs lighting vs background).",
