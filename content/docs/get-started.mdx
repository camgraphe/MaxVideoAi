1. **Create a workspace** and invite teammates from the dashboard. Choose whether you want a shared wallet or
   individual balances for each producer.
2. **Complete the brand brief** so saved defaults and routing hints apply to everyone. Color palettes, logo overlays,
   and preferred aspect ratios sync across all engines once you do.
3. **Connect a wallet** or load Starter Credits ($10) to begin rendering. You can preload with card, wire, or invoice
   billing; refunds on failed renders happen automatically.

### Configure roles

- **Producers** can launch renders, manage jobs, and top up credits.  
- **Reviewers** leave frame-level comments without being charged.  
- **Finance** sees spend reports, invoices, and cost forecasts but cannot generate.

### First render checklist

1. Head to the **Examples** tab and clone a recent job that matches your use case.  
2. Swap the prompt and media, then preview the *Price Before You Generate* chip to confirm the credit cost.  
3. Click **Render** and track status in the queue feed. Each run logs the engine, duration, and any retries for your audit trail.

### API access

Need programmatic control? Request credentials from support@maxvideo.ai and review the webhook section below. The REST
API mirrors the workspace—same prompts, same routing rules—so you can automate high-volume campaigns without rewriting
prompts for every provider.
