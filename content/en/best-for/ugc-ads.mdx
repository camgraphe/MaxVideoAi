## What you're optimizing for
UGC ads need speed, strong product visibility, and predictable motion - without long iteration cycles. The right engine should deliver clean hands, reliable faces, and fast turnarounds at a reasonable cost.

## Top picks (V1)
1. **Veo 3.1** - best balance of fidelity and iteration speed.
2. **Sora 2** - premium fidelity for hero shots.
3. **LTX-2 Fast** - budget-friendly iterations.

## How we rank
We prioritize motion realism, brand consistency, speed (avg + p95), and cost per second. Audio/lipsync is a bonus when ads require dialogue.

## Recommended comparisons
- Sora 2 vs Veo 3.1
- Veo 3.1 vs Kling 2.6 Pro
- Veo 3.1 vs LTX-2
