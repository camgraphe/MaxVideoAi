## What you're optimizing for
Cinematic realism requires stable camera motion, consistent lighting, and believable textures. The best engines should hold detail on faces, hands, and environments.

## Top picks (V1)
1. **Sora 2** - frontier realism for hero shots.
2. **Veo 3.1** - cinematic look with faster iteration.
3. **Kling 2.6 Pro** - strong motion and style control.

## How we rank
We prioritize fidelity, motion physics, and consistency, then speed and cost.

## Recommended comparisons
- Sora 2 vs Veo 3.1
- Veo 3.1 vs Kling 2.6 Pro
- Sora 2 vs Kling 2.6 Pro
