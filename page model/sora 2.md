## What Sora 2 Actually Is in MaxVideoAI

On paper, OpenAI Sora 2 is OpenAI’s short-form text-to-video engine. In practice, the way it behaves for you depends on how it’s integrated.

In **MaxVideoAI**, Sora 2 is exposed as a focused, production-ready engine:

- **Clip length:** 4, 8 or 12 seconds (single generation)  
- **Output:** 720p, ideal for social and concepting  
- **Formats:** 16:9 (landscape) and 9:16 (vertical)  
- **Inputs:**  
  – Text → Video (T2V)  
  – Image → Video (I2V) with PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, GIF or AVIF (up to ~50 MB)  
- **Audio:** always on in this engine; Sora 2 generates sound with the video  
- **Focus:** short, high-impact clips rather than long-form sequences or video-to-video

MaxVideoAI wraps all of this in a simple flow:

1. Pick **Sora 2** as the engine.  
2. Choose **Text → Video** or **Image → Video**.  
3. Set duration and aspect ratio.  
4. Paste a structured prompt.  
5. See the final **price per clip** before you generate.  
6. Compare against other engines in the same GUI.

This turns Sora 2 into a fast **idea machine**: you can get from “rough concept in your head” to “visually convincing clip” in a few minutes.

## Real Specs – Sora 2 in MaxVideoAI

> These specs describe Sora 2 **exactly as you can use it today** via MaxVideoAI – not theoretical capabilities.

### Duration & Output

- **Durations:** 4 s, 8 s, 12 s (you choose)  
- **Output resolution:** 720p (1280×720)

If you need 1080p for higher-end delivery, you can switch to **Sora 2 Pro** in the same interface.

### Aspect Ratios

- 16:9 – classic horizontal / YouTube / web video  
- 9:16 – vertical / TikTok / Reels / Shorts  

Both are supported in Text→Video and Image→Video.

### Inputs & File Types

- **Text prompts** – short, cinematic descriptions in one to three sentences  
- **Reference images** – PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF, AVIF up to ~50 MB  
- No video input in this configuration: you start either from text or from a still image.

### Audio

- Sora 2 returns a video **with audio** – useful if you want a self-contained clip straight out of the engine.  
- If you want to control or replace the sound: you can mute or swap the track in your editor, or use **Sora 2 Pro**, which exposes an audio toggle in the UI.

### Pricing

Sora 2 uses a simple **per-second** pricing model:

- Internal config: `perSecondCents = 12`  
- That’s **$0.12 per second of video**, for example:  
  – 4 seconds ≈ **$0.48**  
  – 8 seconds ≈ **$0.96**  
  – 12 seconds ≈ **$1.44**

No monthly subscription is required: you top up a wallet and only pay for what you generate.

> **Key value proposition**: Sora 2 in MaxVideoAI is the fastest way to test ideas, prototypes and social concepts – you get **studio-style motion & sound** at a predictable cost per second.

## Text-to-Video with Sora 2

Sora 2 works best when you treat your prompt like a **concise shot list** rather than a random wishlist of adjectives.

### A simple pattern that works

In MaxVideoAI, prompts that follow this structure tend to behave well:

1. **Subject and action** – who/what and what they’re doing  
2. **Environment** – where it happens (office, street, café, studio…)  
3. **Camera** – how we see it (wide shot, medium shot, close-up, over-the-shoulder…)  
4. **Movement** – how the camera moves (slow dolly-in, handheld, pan, drone-like…)  
5. **Light & mood** – golden hour, soft daylight, neon night, high contrast, moody…  
6. **Format & duration** – mention 16:9 or 9:16 and whether it’s a 4, 8 or 12 second moment

Example skeleton:

> *Wide shot of [subject] in [environment], lit by [lighting], camera [movement], 8 seconds, 16:9, cinematic, natural colors.*

Drop that into MaxVideoAI, choose Sora 2, and you’re off.

## Image-to-Video with Sora 2 + Nano Banana

One of the advantages of using Sora via MaxVideoAI is that you can **pair it with an image engine like Nano Banana**.

Typical flow:

1. Generate a **reference frame** in Nano Banana that matches your brand style or idea.  
2. Send that still into Sora 2 as **Image → Video**.  
3. Give Sora a prompt that focuses on **motion and timing**:  
   – how the camera should move  
   – what the subject should do  
   – how the shot should end at 4/8/12 seconds  
4. Generate, review, tweak just the motion language if needed, regenerate.

Because the look is anchored by your reference image, you can iterate on **movement and timing** while keeping **style and composition consistent**. That’s extremely useful for:

- product shots that must stay on-brand  
- hero visuals for landing pages  
- short looping scenes you might use in ads or UI backgrounds

## Multi-Shot & Sequenced Clips – The Sora 2 “Mini-Film” Trick

This is one of the most exciting capabilities of Sora 2: it can interpret **multi-step prompts** and compress **several shots** into a single 8 or 12 second clip.

If you give Sora 2 a prompt like:

- “First… then… finally…”  
- or clearly separate **Shot 1**, **Shot 2**, **Shot 3**

…it tries to stage the clip as a sequence of beats, with changes in framing and subject action.

### How we recommend doing it

- Aim for **2–3 shots maximum** in one clip (beyond that, things can get noisy).  
- Give each shot **one main action and one clear camera move**.  
- Reuse key elements (“same woman in a blue blazer”, “same kitchen”, “same lighting”) so Sora understands continuity.  
- Avoid trying to jump through five radically different locations in 8 seconds – Sora is good, but it’s still constrained by the clip length.

## Demo: One Sequenced Prompt (With a Matching Clip)

Here’s a realistic **multi-shot Sora 2 prompt** you can use as a pattern. On the page, you can show the **actual video** generated from this prompt next to it.

> **Prompt – 8 second micro-film (16:9)**  
> *Shot 1 (0–3s): Wide establishing shot of a modern kitchen at sunrise, warm soft window light, a glass jar of coffee beans on a wooden counter, camera slowly pushes in, 16:9.*  
> *Shot 2 (3–6s): Medium close-up of a hand opening the jar and pouring beans into a grinder, soft focus background, natural light catching a bit of steam, 16:9.*  
> *Shot 3 (6–8s): Close-up of freshly brewed coffee swirling in a ceramic mug, slow zoom in as the steam rises toward the camera, cozy and inviting mood, 16:9.*

This shows:

- shot transitions  
- consistent environment and props  
- clear camera motion in each segment  
- a complete “story beat” in under 10 seconds

You can adapt this structure to anything:

- skincare → three beats around applying the product  
- SaaS → three beats around using the app in different contexts  
- fitness → three beats around warming up, exercising, and cooling down

Later, we can link from here to a dedicated **“Sora 2 Prompt Lab”** page that lists more prompts and variants.

## Tips & Limitations in Plain English

Sora 2 is impressive, but like any model, it has a profile.

**Play to its strengths:**

- Short, vivid moments  
- Clear subject and action  
- Simple environments (office, street, café, home…)  
- Film-like camera behavior (dolly, pan, handheld, etc.)  
- Great for UGC-feeling footage and cinematic inserts

**Know its boundaries:**

- Outputs are **720p**, not 1080p – Sora 2 Pro covers higher resolution.  
- It’s **4–12 seconds**, not long-form. You stitch multiple clips if you want something longer.  
- It doesn’t take video input; you start from **text or image**.  
- It doesn’t expose seeds – you iterate by refining the prompt and re-running.  
- Like all current models, it can struggle with very small or detailed text.

When you understand this and write prompts accordingly, Sora 2 becomes a predictable tool instead of a slot machine.

## Safety & People / Likeness

Sora 2 in MaxVideoAI follows safety constraints similar to OpenAI’s:

- You should **not** generate real people or public figures (no celebrities, politicians, etc.).  
- No minors, sexual content, hateful content or graphic violence.  
- Don’t use another person’s likeness without their consent.  
- Some prompts and input images will be blocked if they violate these principles.

From a user point of view, that means:

- if you describe a generic user, model, character → fine  
- if you try “make it look like [famous person]” or anything sensitive → it may fail or be filtered

This is by design: it’s how both MaxVideoAI and Sora 2 stay usable and safe for professionals.
